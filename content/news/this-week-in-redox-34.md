# What's new in Redox?

## TL;DR

Welcome to the last TWiRx of the year!

2017 has been fantastic! The project has been more active and vibrant than ever.
The team worked super hard and shipped a ton of interesting stuff! I am preparing a summary of the most interesting things that happened in 2017 and I will be publishing it in a few days. So stay tuned!

Without further ado, here is what happened this last few weeks:

Big news! We were surprised this week by [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51) and his news about the plans to create a foundation to support and foster Redox OS and it's ecosystem. This is really good news! More on it on the upcoming issues. 

In the main top-level repo (**redox**) `netdb` (which contains the default `/etc/hosts` and friends) is now included in the filesystem by default. Also, [@jD91mZM2](https://github.com/jD91mZM2) fixed the rust toolchain to `nightly-2017-12-21` as the `ring` does not work with the latest `nightly`.

In the **kernel** there was a super cool page table optimization made by [@weclaw1](https://github.com/weclaw1), basically now we use bits `51-61` in the first entries of each page table as a counter for used entries. After this change, checking if page table is empty is a `O(1)` operation instead of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of entries, Neato!

The `null` and `zero` daemons which implement the `null:` and `zero:` schemes respectively where moved to userspace by [@Arcterus](https://github.com/Arcterus), along with a shinny new `frename` implementation.

As you might suspect, the **syscall** crate the new, shinny `frename` call, <3.

**Redoxfs** got renaming support with the implementation of `frename`. 

**Ion**, The Redox (and Linux) shell, saw a lot of activity, notably the addition of the `exec` builtin by [@dlrobertson](https://github.com/dlrobertson), the addition of a title bar setting and the ability to produce any character using hex code by [@jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51). [@nihathrael](https://github.com/nihathrael) was busy adding the `@lines()` and `@reverse()` methods while [@mmstick](https://github.com/mmstick) made a change to use a static map for simple color lookups, removed `Shell::update_variables`, added `UID` and `EUID`, added support for enabling forks to ignore streams, fixed `EAGAIN` error on forks and started to work on library/binary separation.

The **cookbook** saw the birth of a `newlib` test suite, packages for the recently moved to userspace `nulld` and `zerod` daemons, some improvements to the `bash` along a fixed the `raw-bin` (which was broken because of the recent changes to `redox_users`'s API).   

On the GUI side of things, **Orbtk** the widget toolkit saw a change by [@FloVanGH](https://github.com/FloVanGH) who used `include_bytes!` to load icons on ComboBoxes.

Also UI related, **Orbterm**, the terminal emulator, received an Ion related fix which unsets the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` variables while [@jD91mZM2](https://github.com/jD91mZM2) landed the initial configuration support.

**libextra** got a new `unwrap_or_exit` helper meant to simplify a lot of repetitive code in the `*utils` (and CLI apps) packages.

Finally, in the land of the utils (**coreutils** and **userutils**), there were only two minor changes related to using `unwrap_or_exit` and the new APIs exposed by `redox_users`.

Thanks to all the people who supported the project this year, from the contributors to the patreons, and all the people that spread the word, and the Rust community for creating such an amazing tool, enabling us our ultimate objective: to create a modern, lightweight fast and above all, a safer operating system. 

See you next year!
